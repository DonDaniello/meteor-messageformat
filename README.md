MessageFormat support, the Meteor way.

Easy reactive use of complicated strings (gender, plural, etc) with insanely easy
translation into other languages (through a web UI).

For full info, docs and examples, see the [Meteor MessageFormat home page](http://messageformat.meteor.com/) (or install/clone the smart package and run `mrt` in its `website` directory).
