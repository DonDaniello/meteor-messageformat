		<p><i>NB: this is still a preview release.  Some things marked as TODO aren't implemented yet.</i></p>

		<p><b>MessageFormat for Meteor</b> seamlessly adds support for complicated strings
		(multiple gender, plural, offset, in any permutation) to your project, and
		facilitates the translation of these strings to multiple languages.  All in
		a way you'd expect from a Meteor package.</p>

		<p>{{#markdown}}The package provides both a JavaScript `mf()` function, and
		Handlebars `{{dstache}}mf}}` and `{{dstache}}#mf}}` helpers to be used in templates.  The
		latter are automatically reactive, and will rerender themselves when any
		of the variables used are changed by a reactive computation (e.g. string,
		gender, count, or language).{{/markdown}}</p>

		<p>The package builds on <a href="https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js/"
		>MessageFormat.js by Alex Sexton</a>.  You should read that page for a good 
		explanation of how MessageFormat works and why it's a better option than <i>gettext</i>, or simply browse the <a href="/examples">examples</a> page to see the different
		combinations possible and how they rerender themselves reactively, with no
		additional work on your part.</p>

<a name="features"></a>
## Features

* [Reactive](/examples) (strings will update themselves when variables or language changes)
* Handles MessageFormat.js plural and offset, and selectformat (e.g. for gender)
* [Full translation Web UI](/translate), no need to redeploy your app as new translations arrive

<a name="quickstart"></a>
## Quick Start

Meteor MessageFormat can be installed with
[Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite/). From inside a Meteorite-managed app:

```bash
$ mrt add messageformat
```

In your project, add:

```js
mfPkg.init('en');
```

replacing 'en' with the native language of your project, if appropriate.  Additionally,
a second argument may be supplied, more on that [below](#options).

### Handlebars styled Templates

```html
{{dstache}}mf 'keyname' 'keytext' VAR1=TemplateVar VAR2=etc}}
```

For longer MessageFormat Strings, you can do this:
```html
{{dstache}}#mf KEY='keyname' VAR1=TemplateVar VAR2=etc}}
    long keytext
{{dstache}}/#mf}
```

For real live example, see the [examples](/examples) page.

Notes:

1. *TemplateVar*, etc, are *regular template variables or helper functions*.  Reactivity is maintained!  You can throw in a quoted value here for testing (e.g. VAR1='male')

2. *keytext* is potentially optional.  You could have all text compiled in advance (by hand, for now), and thus also reduce the size of your templates.  However, I made this available as an option since it's much easier to have text inline in your code and automatically extract it later; I feel this was what made the adoption of gettext so successful.  It also provides a useful fallback.

3. You can also optionally pass a `LOCALE=value` to control the translation of just a single block.
 
### Javascript (if needed)

```
mf(key, params, message, locale);
```

Notes:

1. *message* is optional (can be *null*), as per the above.
2. *locale* is optional, defaults to Session.get('locale');

### Translation

Again, this is still a work in progress. Currently there is a tool to extact strings from templates and javascript, and early management for translations. Go to your project root dir:

```bash
sudo npm install -g meteor-messageformat
mf_extract
```

Run `mf_extract` every time you want to update the strings in your project.  Make sure
to always run it in the root directory of your project.  The program reads and writes
to `server/mfExtract.js`.

Manage translations at `/translate` in your app (security/authentication coming soon).

<a name="options"></a>
### Options

Options are specified at init time.  Usage:

```js
mfPkg.init('en', {
	option: value,
	...
});
```

Available options:

<table id="tOptions">
	<tr>
		<th>Option</th>
		<th>Values</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>sendPolicy</td>
		<td>'current' (default) or 'all'</td>
		<td>Languages to send to client</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<a name="underhood"></a>
## Under the Hood

<a name="extraction"></a>
### Extraction

**Always run mf_extract in the root directory of your project**

The `mf_extract` tool will recursively walk through your project (skipping symlinks),
looking for *.js and *.html files, and extracting the strings from any calls to
`mf()`, `{{dstache}}mf}}` and `{{dstache}}#mf}}`.

It writes a `server/mfExtract.js` where it notes the string, the file and line
number where it was found, and the name of the containing template or function
name.  **When this file is loaded by Meteor, the Web UI is enabled by default,
allowing translations by any logged in user.  See [options](#options), above,
to fine tune the security policy.  TODO.

Note, it doesn't only write to this file.  If the file already exists, it is
loaded first, and this is how we know if a string has been updated or removed
since the last run.

In the future, when Meteor [allows multiple source handlers](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/meteor-core/0QJa5EAXQhc/lJ71DqLipcQJ), this process will be handled
automatically when Meteor loads, without the need to run an external utility.

<a name="translation"></a>
### Translation

The `mfStrings` collection contains the info of all *current* strings in the project.
The `mfRevisions` collection contains the revision history of each string.

When a source/native string is updated, all translations for that key are marked
as **fuzzy** (just like machine translations).

Strings that are translations contain a `sourceId` field, which is the `revisionId`
of the source string it was translated against.  In the future, translators will
be able to see the diff of a source string for fuzzy translations, for convenience.

<a name="clientsync"></a>
### Client Sync (what's sent over the wire)

Native strings are always sent to the client, since they are already compiled into
your templates.  This is both convenient for developers, and useful as a fallback
for clients, if a translation does not exist.

However, since `keytext` is optional, you could opt to omit it, and thus avoid
sending the native strings for users of other languages.  However, missing strings
will just show the `keyname` (TODO, logic to auto fill missing keys).

By default, translations are loaded *on demand*.  When a user changes languages,
translations are sent in a { key1: text1, key2: text2 } format using a Meteor method.
Updated keys for the current language are sent through a regular publish function.
Strings are cached; if the user changs languages, strings will not be sent over the
wire again, except for strings that were updated.

If you want language changing to be quicker, you use run `mfPkg.init` with the
`loadLangs: 'all`' option.

Note: the strings themselves are not reactive.  Users will see updated strings
next time the string is rendered.  This is to avoid annoying and confusing the
user with strings changing before their eyes if people are working on translations.

TODO: reactive ready() functions to wait on.

In the future, offline collections will be supported (via e.g.
[offline-data](https://github.com/awwx/meteor-offline-data) or
[GroundedDB](https://github.com/GroundMeteor/Meteor-GroundDB)), and strings
will be cached offline on the client and only updated strings will be synced
on reconnect.

<a name="whyusekeys"></a>
## Why use Keys?

It's true that *gettext* doesn't require us to name our strings with keys, and
has a smart algorithm to know if a string is a new string or an update to an
existing string, through a combination of string simularity (fuzzy matching)
and string location (file, approx. position).

This is very convenient for the programmer, but not fullproof.  It can occassionally
cause problems (mismatched translations) which are better to be avoided.  Also, in
the case where we're sending all strings over the wire, we might prefer to optimize
our app, sending over smaller key names rather than all the complete strings (when
not using the native lang) -- although currently we don't recommend this yet (TODO).

<a name="misc"></a>
## Misc

<a name="glossary"></a>
## Glossary

* **Internationalization (i18n)** - support for multiple languages (translation)
* **Localization (l10n)** - cultural support for e.g. dates, number formatting, etc.
* **Locale** - language and culture info, e.g. en_US is both US English and US formatting

<a name="roadmap"></a>
### Roadmap

1. ~~Extract all strings from templates to allow for translation~~ DONE (TODO, consider
precompilation options)

1. It would be nice if *keyname* could be unique *per template*, but currently [there is no way for a template helper to know the name of a calling template](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/658)

1. ~~Longer term: Allow additional languages to be loaded *as needed*, and reactively rerender all dependencies once it's available.~~ DONE

1. ~~Longest term: create a system to allow for string building and translation online (also in MessageFormat.js')~~ STARTED, early release, TODO - string builder wizard for
translators, with dropdown blocks and permutation previews

1. ~~Longest term~~: a centrally hosted website to handle translation for apps using the
smart package.

<a name="differences"></a>
### Differences to the original MessageFormat.js by Alex Sexton

1. The original package requires all language strings to be defined externally (optionally in a per-directory basis).  I prefered the option to define them inline and have a tool to extract them for precompilation (see note about this, above).

2. The above naming structure is another reason why I don't currently allow for the existing precompilation code to be used.  In a Meteor style project, it makes more sense to use the Template names as part of the hierarchy.

2. It's unclear whether the original package, once it adds multi-language support, will allow multiple languages to be loaded in memory simultaneously.
